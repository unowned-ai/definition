# Unowned AI

## Manifesto

Amazon, Google, and Microsoft mediate nearly all large-model computation. Model vendors like OpenAI and Anthropic rent access through those same clouds. In doing so, they record every
prompt and every output. If this continues, everyone outside a narrow shareholder class will be reduced to serfs, beholden to a handful of megacorporations for access to private cognition.

Advanced accelerators are scarce. Only the wealthiest corporations can maintain clusters of the size needed for training. As demand for frontier models grows, this scarcity of
hardware magnifies corporate control over AI.

It is not too late to act. GPU manufacturers still sell to any lawful buyer, and clever engineering continues to prove that capable models can be trained with far less hardware than
the early pioneers required. The door to self-sovereign AI is still open.

Unowned AI stands for free artificial intelligence. That's free as in freedom. Open in every respect, from datasets to model definitions to weights. We are not a company. We do not
seek to make a profit. We are a collective of programmers and users, building and sharing tools that make free use of AI possible.
